This folder includes data and scripts used for Figure 2 and Figures S5.

You can find the following file types:


 **_intra_OTU_Zotus_prevalence.txt**:  these files are showing the prevalence (as described in Fig 2 a/c) for each OTU sequence variant across soil, RS, RP and Root samples. These values are the 
basis for the boxplots of Figure 2 C.

**_intra_OTU_Zotus_fasta.txt**: reference sequences for those OTU sequence variants.


In addition you can find the **Fig_2_and_S5_abun_vs_preval.r** script. This R script will produce the panels you can see in Figure 2 A/B and S5. The script will create one table called otu_def_num_sites , this table inlcude the preavalence values for All OTUs, for soil, RS, RP and Root ad the respective years separate. Whereas you can find the RA of each OTU within otu_def_avg_ra(_log).
