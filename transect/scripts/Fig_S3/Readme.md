This folder includes data and scripts used for Figure S3.

**Fig_2_and_S5_abun_vs_preval.r**  This R script will produce the panels you can see in Figure S3 a. Note that the plots are based on the Distance between Site centroids (!) and NOT on distances between individual samples and their centroids (standard betadisper analysis).
