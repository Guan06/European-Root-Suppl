This folder includes data and scripts used for Figure S3.

**Fig_S3_beta_disp_site_cen.r**  This R script will produce the panels you can see in Figure S3 a. Note that the plots are based on the Distance between Site centroids (!) and NOT on distances between individual samples and their centroids (standard betadisper analysis).

**Fig_S3_shared_otu.r**  This R script will produce the panels you can see in Figure S3 b/c, depending on the input file. Use the ***_high_abun.txt as input for panel b and ***_low_abun.txt for panel c.

The respective files are tables showing the number of shared OTUs (either only high abundant ones or only low abundant ones) between all samples (count and percentage).
