DATASET_MULTIBAR
#In multi-value bar charts, each ID is associated to multiple numeric values, which are displayed as a stacked or aligned bar chart
#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#select the separator which is used to delimit the data below (TAB,SPACE or COMMA).This separator must be used throughout this file (except in the SEPARATOR line, which uses space).
#SEPARATOR TAB
#SEPARATOR SPACE
SEPARATOR COMMA

#label is used in the legend table (can be changed later)
DATASET_LABEL,example multi bar chart

#dataset color (can be changed later)
COLOR,#ff0000

#define colors for each individual field column (use hexadecimal, RGB or RGBA notation; if using RGB/RGBA, COMMA cannot be used as SEPARATOR)
FIELD_COLORS,#cc3300,#ff6633,#ffcc00,#fff5cc,#ffe6ff,#8c8c8c

#field labels
FIELD_LABELS,Albuginales,Lagenidiales,Peronosporales,Pythiales,Saprolegniales,Other

#                    OPTIONAL SETTINGS                            #
#=================================================================#

#dataset scale: you can simply set the values where the scale will be drawn
#DATASET_SCALE,2000,10000,20000
#or you can specify value, label and color for each scale line (dash separated, format: VALUE-LABEL-COLOR) 
#DATASET_SCALE,2000-2k line-#0000ff,10000-line at 10k-#ff0000,20000-3rd line-#00ff00

#each dataset can have a legend, which is defined below
#for each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label
#shape should be a number between 1 and 6:
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#LEGEND_TITLE,Dataset legend
#LEGEND_SHAPES,1,2,3
#LEGEND_COLORS,#ff0000,#00ff00,#0000ff
#LEGEND_LABELS,value1,value2,value3

#=================================================================#
#     all other optional settings can be set or changed later     #
#           in the web interface (under 'Datasets' tab)           #
#=================================================================#

#maximum width
WIDTH,500

#left margin, used to increase/decrease the spacing to the next dataset. Can be negative, causing datasets to overlap.
#MARGIN,0

#always show internal values; if set, values associated to internal nodes will be displayed even if these nodes are not collapsed. It could cause overlapping in the dataset display.
#SHOW_INTERNAL,0

#bar height factor; Default bar height will be slightly less than the available space between leaves, but you can set a multiplication factor here to increase/decrease it (values from 0 to 1 will decrease it, values above 1 will increase it)
#HEIGHT_FACTOR,1

#Bars are aligned to the node lines by default. Using BAR_SHIFT, you can move them all up/down by a fixed amount
#BAR_SHIFT,0

#align individual fields; if set to 1, individual bar charts will not be stacked
ALIGN_FIELDS,0

#border width; if set above 0, a border of specified width (in pixels) will be drawn around the bars
#BORDER_WIDTH,0

#border color; used when BORDER_WIDTH is above 0
#BORDER_COLOR,#0000ff

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages
